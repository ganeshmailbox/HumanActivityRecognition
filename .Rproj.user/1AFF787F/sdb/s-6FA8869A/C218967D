    "contents" : "## Introduction\n\nThis assignment uses data from\nthe <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones \">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a>, The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called out in the CodeBook.md.\n\n\n* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href=\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip\">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a> [61Mb]\n\n* <b>Description</b>: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.\n\n* <b>Codebook</b>: Human Activity Recognition variables are described in the github repository mentioned below and please refer to <b>Codebook.md</b> for the same.\n\n\n## Data Cleansing /Tidy data\n\n\nThe data set required multiple steps for tidy-ing, here are steps that are done:\n\n* Bring all the data sets and bind them togather. Use better names from the features.txt file.\n\n* Interestingly there were few duplicate names in the features list. These were removed. Went for wide output option, rather than colapsing the data measures. This makes column operation easy. \n\n*  The varible with \"mean\" and \"std\" were searched with ignore case, and all of these variables which contains this text were used for tydiying. \n\n* Used merge to provide descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\n\n* Utilized gsub to make the variable names more appropriate for use in plot and other functions in future. the charecters \"-\", \",\", \")\" and \"(\" were considered improper and they were replaced with \"_\" (for fist two), empty strings for brackets. Also replaced \"BodyBody\" with just \"Body\"\n\n* Finally use dplyr to group (by activity and then subject) and get the mean for each variable for each group.\n\n* The final output <i>alldata_merged_with_mean.txt<i> file is is to be read with read.table with header=TRUE. The variable names are provided on the top, for better readability.  \n\n## Deliverables\n\nThere were really two submittions a) the final step 5 submission and b) providing the github and also the \ncodebook and this readme file.\n\nFirst you will need to check the following GitHub repository:\n[https://github.com/ganeshmailbox/HumanActivityRecognition](https://github.com/ganeshmailbox/HumanActivityRecognition)\n\n##Notes: \n- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].\n- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.\n\nFor more information about this dataset contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws\n\n##License:\n\nUpdated version of the data provided below.\n\nUse of this dataset in publications must be acknowledged by referencing the following publication [1] \n\n[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
